I'll give you a hint %ra. If you want to succeed in magic, join the mages guild.
                                     <--->
A small tip for you. Put your money in the bank of %reg. Have them give you letters of credit. They hardly weigh a thing.
                                     <--->
Specialty shops are the best place to find unsual items.
                                     <---> 
They just passed a vagrancy law. You can't sleep in the streets. The guards even patrol outside the walls. You have to get a room at an Inn.
                                     <--->
Everyone should join a temple. The only question is what god is best for you? I'd check into them all.
                                    <--->
Things are really heating up in the city of Daggerfall. You should go there if you want adventure.
                                     <--->
I've heard that the royalty of Wayrest is stirring things up. It's a great opportunity for anyone with the guts to actually ask the king or queen for work.
                                     <--->
I've heard that Sentinel is a good place to earn quick gold and the opportunity for a bit of adventure. The royal family is hiring heroes for dangerous work.

--the rumors previously placed in "during quest" have been moved to "after quest." The tutorial was way too short for these messages
--to appear normally, so having them in rumor mill for 7 days after quest ends is an OK window.
--could theoretically make tutorial extend on much longer in an invisible state and keep rumors
--present for a long time.

<ce>             Daggerfall Unity has an updated tutorial.
<ce>           It will teach you the basics of gameplay.
<ce>          Make sure to take notes on the info it presents.
<ce>               Do you want to use this tutorial?

<ce>                                    
<ce>           The very first thing you want to do is to check
<ce>           your keybinds. Press Escape and click on Controls.
<ce>           The most important ones for now are your movement (WASD)
<ce>           and your Swing Weapon (Mouse1 by default). Attacking
<ce>           may involve holding the Swing Weapon button down
<ce>           and moving the mouse; OR clicking the Swing Weapon
<ce>           button, OR holding it down. This can be changed
<ce>           in the Advanced section of the Controls screen.
<ce>           
<ce>           Make sure your binds are acceptable,
<ce>           and another message will appear in 10 seconds.

<ce>                                    
<ce>          Now press F6 to open your inventory. Equip any armor
<ce>           available to you, and the best weapon you have.
<ce>           "Best weapon" refers to a weapon that your character is skilled in,
<ce>           and/or is a very strong material (ie: Elven, Dwarven).
<ce>           Without those two advantages, you will almost never hit enemies.
<ce>

<ce>        Equipping a weapon requires a short delay. When it's ready,
<ce>        press Z to bring it out. You can also use your fist if your
<ce>        Hand-to-Hand skill is high. Practice some attacks with the
<ce>        Swing Weapon button.

<ce>          Press R to rest when you need to regain health, stamina,
<ce>        or magicka. Those indicators are at the bottom-left of the screen.
<ce>          You don't need to rest right now, but remember it for later.

<ce>         Characters with magic available can also try casting spells,
<ce>         though enemies will often resist your spells. Press Backspace
<ce>         to open your spellbook, if you are a spellcaster. Double-click
<ce>         on a spell to ready it.
<ce>         
<ce>         Some spells require a target, and others are cast automatically
<ce>         on yourself. If it's a targeted spell, use left mouse click
<ce>         to cast it after it's readied. Use Q to re-ready a spell that you
<ce>         cast before, so you can rapid-fire spells as needed.

<ce>         If you haven't saved the game yet, do so now. Press Escape and
<ce>         click on Save Game. The Quicksave button, defined in
<ce>         Controls -> Advanced (at the bottom of the Controls screen)
<ce>         is something you can also use to save.

<ce>           Your first step to escape this cave is to exit this room.
<ce>           Go down the hallway opposite the campfire.
<ce>           After the turn, you will find a door resembling a brick wall.
<ce>           Click on the door to open it. Beyond, you will see a small room
<ce>           with a rat and a treasure pile on an altar.
<ce>           
<ce>           Clicking on the treasure pile will open the inventory.
<ce>           You will see the treasure pile's contents on the right side
<ce>           of the inventory screen. With the "remove" option highlighted,
<ce>           click on the items to grab them for yourself.
<ce>           
<ce>           You can also loot enemy corpses after killing them,
<ce>            but the rat will have no treasure.

<ce>         Continue through the dungeon. You can choose to fight
<ce>        or escape from the enemies.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         You will need weapons made of stronger materials to hit
<ce>         some monsters. The upcoming imp monster can't be hurt with
<ce>         iron weapons. You need steel or stronger to hurt it.
<ce>         Your fists will also work, but you need
<ce>         a high Hand-to-Hand skill before it will succeed.

<ce>         Some monsters are stronger than you. You can escape from them
<ce>         without consequence. If an enemy is giving you a lot of trouble,
<ce>         run away and leave it behind. You don't gain experience from killing
<ce>         enemies, so a strong enemy gives no more reward than a weak one.

<ce>         Some objects can be clicked on. In the main hall of this
<ce>        dungeon, you will find a throne and a lever next to it.
<ce>        When you see the lever, click on it to raise the throne
<ce>        like an elevator. Other dungeons will have objects
<ce>         with more effects, such as wheels and secret switches.
<ce>
<ce>         To escape this dungeon, you need to look for a dark, stone
<ce>        archway set into a wall, about the same height as you.
<ce>        When you click on it, you will exit the dungeon and enter
<ce>        the outdoors. The next message will appear at that time.

<ce>         The world of Daggerfall is immense
<ce>         and generally can't be traveled in real time.
<ce>         
<ce>         Open the travel map (normally by pressing V).
<ce>        The region that you are in is highlighted in red.
<ce>         Click on that region and you get a focused map.
<ce>        Click FIND and type in DAGGERFALL.
<ce>         
<ce>           For now, keep the travel settings on CAUTIOUSLY and INNS.
<ce>               These settings will ensure you arrive in the morning.
<ce>             You do not want to arrive in Daggerfall City at night.

<ce>    Find a townsperson nearby. Press F4 to set your mode
<ce>        to Dialogue, and then click on the person. You will
<ce>        enter a conversation window. You can use the window
<ce>        to ask for directions to places. If a person is unfriendly or
<ce>    doesn't know, find another peasant.
<ce>    
<ce>    Once a peasant tells you what direction a building is in,
<ce>        you can keep repeating the request until they mark it
<ce>        on your map. This is very important for finding
<ce>    locations easily in a large city like this one.

<ce>       If you gained treasure in the starting dungeon,
<ce>        you will want to sell it. A pawn shop is most useful
<ce>        for this, though general stores and armorsmiths
<ce>       can also buy some kinds of goods. Find one such store
<ce>        somewhere in town. You can ask peasants for directions
<ce>        to them, or press F3 to change to Info mode, and click
<ce>        on the buildings to learn what they are from a distance.
<ce>       
<ce>       General stores open at 6 AM. Pawn shops and armorsmiths
<ce>        open later. Check the current time in-game (usually the 'i' key).
<ce>        If the stores are still closed, press the Rest button
<ce>        to loiter (not rest) until they open.
<ce>       
<ce>       Note that if you loiter right now,
<ce>        the next tutorial message will appear immediately.

<ce>      Most characters want to join at least one guild.
<ce>        As you rise in rank in a guild, you get more benefits.
<ce>        To rise in rank, you must improve skills the guild
<ce>        cares about, and perform quests on a regular basis
<ce>        to improve your reputation with them.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        All spellcasters should join the Mages Guild. Fighter type
<ce>        characters can join the Fighters Guild and a knightly order.
<ce>        You can also pick a temple to join.
<ce>        
<ce>        You can only be a member of one temple and one knightly order. 
<ce>                                    
<ce>         There are other hidden guilds in the game as well.

<ce>        The last task of all is to find a quest.
<ce>        Daggerfall's quests are radiant, choosing locations
<ce>        around you as places where things will happen.
<ce>  
<ce>        Doing quests for guilds will help you increase
<ce>        in rank with them, so they may be a priority for you.
<ce>        After you have joined the guild, find someone inside the
<ce>        guild building with the button "Get Quest."
<ce>         Accept or reject the quest you are given.
<ce>        Rejecting a quest has no consequences.

<ce>  Many quests will send you to other towns.
<ce>        If they do, enter your journal (normally L) and click
<ce>  on the quest log entry about that quest.
<ce>        Many times, it will automatically plan
<ce>  a travel to your quest destination.
<ce>        Otherwise, you can open the travel screen
<ce>  and choose the location yourself.
<ce>  
<ce>  You can also find quests among random townspeople.
<ce>        Click on people in taverns, who tend to
<ce>  have quests. You can also get them from shopkeepers
<ce>        with the "Talk" button.
<ce>  Asking for "Any work?" can lead you to possible questgivers.

<ce>       This is the end of the tutorial. Daggerfall is a game with many
<ce>       unique and intricate mechanics, so learn from other players
<ce>       about the game's quirks. You can also add mods to the game
<ce>       once you understand the basic mechanics.
